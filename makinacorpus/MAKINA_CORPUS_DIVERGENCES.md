MakinaCorpus Saltstack fork
=======================================

- We unmarked the makina corpus repo to be an official fork to keep only one branch, without release.
  This drastically improve git clones as the repo is for now < 50 mo (~160mo for saltstack's one)
- We contribute a lot to salt, but pullrequests will be done via other forks to avoid growing this repo size

DIVERGENCES TO KEEP AT ALL COSTS:
----------------------------------
- [protect VT logs from unicode strings / 6039f1a8327892978da220b50f30e002c97d0a51](https://github.com/makinacorpus/salt/commit/6039f1a8327892978da220b50f30e002c97d0a51)

    - Upstream did not accepted this trivial changeset, even as a later changeable changeset, issue is pending for more than a while here:

        - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/21441
        - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/20918

- [raise appropriate AttributeEror for certain collectionmapping attributes / 86afa91b189cfe80b497cbe9d5489bf2212acc29](https://github.com/makinacorpus/salt/commit/86afa91b189cfe80b497cbe9d5489bf2212acc29)

    - for tests reasons only, but in spirit the loader doesnt respect without the patch that much a dict-like interface toward the copy method.
